1. What is version control, and why is GitHub so popular?
Version control is like a "save history" for your code. It keeps track of every change so you can go back if something breaks. GitHub is popular because it makes collaboration easy—you can work with others, review code, and manage projects in one place.
2. How does version control help maintain project integrity?
It prevents disasters! If you mess something up, you can roll back to a previous version. It also helps teams work together smoothly without overwriting each other’s work.
3. How do you set up a new repository on GitHub?
Go to GitHub and click the "+" button → New repository
Choose a name (e.g., "my-awesome-project")
Decide if it should be public (anyone can see) or private (only you and invited people)
Add a README file (optional but recommended)
Click Create repository
4. Why is the README file important?
It’s like a welcome mat for your project. It explains what your project does, how to use it, and any setup instructions. A good README makes it easier for others to understand and contribute.
5. Public vs. Private Repositories—What’s the Difference?
Public: Anyone can see and contribute. Great for open-source projects but not for sensitive code.
Private: Only invited users can access. Ideal for personal or confidential work.
Trade-off: Public is good for collaboration, while private gives more control.
6. How do you make your first commit?
Commits are like saving your progress in a game. Each commit captures a snapshot of your project.
Steps:
Make changes to your files
Run git add . (this stages the changes)
Run git commit -m "Your message" (this saves the changes)
Run git push (this uploads it to GitHub)
7. What is branching, and why is it useful?
Branches let you work on new features without messing up the main project. Imagine testing a new idea without affecting the live version!
Create a branch: git checkout -b new-feature
Work on changes
Merge it back using a pull request
8. What are pull requests, and how do they help?
A pull request is like asking your team, "Hey, can you review my work before we add it to the main project?" It allows discussion, code review, and approval before merging changes.
9. What’s forking, and how is it different from cloning?
Forking = making a personal copy of someone else's project. You can change it without affecting the original.
Cloning = downloading a copy of a repo to your computer, but you don’t own it.
Use forking when you want to contribute to an open-source project.
10. How do GitHub Issues & Project Boards help?
They keep things organized!
Issues track bugs and feature requests.
Project boards help manage tasks visually (like a to-do list).
11. Common GitHub Challenges & Best Practices
Forgetting to commit often? Make small, frequent commits.
Conflicts when merging? Communicate with your team and resolve conflicts early.
Not sure how to use Git commands? Use GitHub Desktop—it has a simple UI!
